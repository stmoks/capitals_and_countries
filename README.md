
## Capitals and countries

I like to think geography creates a good mental map for thinking about history and language.
So I'm putting together data from different sources
to help create my own mental map of how the world works.

This is meant to serve as mostly a backend for collecting the data and serving it using FastAPI. In here, there are a few modules that will eventually be added to serve different informational verticals. 

### Additional Notes

- Different datasets might contain the same information, but have different encodings or data types. This is often the case when dealing with data that could be in varying languages. In this dataset, this was partly due to the differences in endonyms and exonyms. Other times, it was simply because some sites tables consider all the necessary special characters while other skip some or all.
