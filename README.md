## Country Capitals

By scraping data from two Wikipedia links, I put together a table containing the capitals of the world along with basic information about them such as the country, continent, population, and coordinates associated with them.

At the bottom of the script, I use SQL Lite to answer some basic questions about the data. The questions I answer include the following:

1. Which countries have more than 1 capital city?
2. What are the most populous capital cities?
3. Which capital cities have the highest elevation?

### Additional Notes

- Different datasets might contain the same information, but have different encodings or data types. This is often the case when dealing with data that could be in varying languages.
